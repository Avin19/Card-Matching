# Card Matching 



## To Do List 
- [x] Added Simple Menu Scence
- [ ] Ensure smooth gameplay with animations for card flipping and matching.
- [ ] The system should allow continuous card flipping without requiring users to wait for card comparisons to finish before selecting additional cards.
- [ ] Support various card layouts, such as 2x2, 2x3, 5x6, etc. The cards should scale to fit the
target display area, whether it's the screen or another container widget.
- [ ] Implement a save/load system to persist progress between game restarts.
- [ ] Include a scoring mechanism.
- [ ] Integrate basic sound effects for card flipping, matching, mismatching, and game over
(limited to these four scenarios).
